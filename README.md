# NGWeeklyCalendarCollectionView
A Horizontal Collection View for showing a weekly calendar view somewhat similar to Apples Calendar Application.
Not a complete independent component as yet, but you can easily customise it to your requirement, very easily.

Tested on Simulator 5.2 
Xcode 7+
Deployment Target 7+

Hope you enjoy.
